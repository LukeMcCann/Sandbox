  storyText: 'You lunge at the guard slamming him into the bars.


    The guard quickly overpowers you bringing you to your knees, you feel intense
    pain as his vice-like grip pierces your collar bone, his metal gloves driving
    into your flesh. You feel your bone beginning to break, as he forces you to the
    ground sitting atop of you. You take one blow to the face knocking you bloody
    and dizzy, another renders you near unconcious.


    You feel his hands grasp around your throat as your life begins to drain from
    you.


    1. Fight for your life

    2. Give up'
