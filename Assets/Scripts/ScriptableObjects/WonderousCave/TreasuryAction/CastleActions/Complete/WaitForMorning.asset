  storyText: "You awaken to a creek as your cell is opened, guards pick you up from
    the floor, dragging you by the arms.\n\nDisoriented, dehydrated, and hungry you
    cannot decipher what is going on, you feel gravel beneath your feet, and then
    a tight sensation around your neck. A crowds cheering fills your ears, as a voice
    rings out over the crowd. \n\nYou realise you are about to be executed. \n\n1.
    Try to buy time\n2. Try to escape\n3. Proclaim innocence"
