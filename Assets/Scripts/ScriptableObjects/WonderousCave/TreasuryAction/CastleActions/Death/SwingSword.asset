  storyText: "You swing your sword, the bolt sinks deep into your arm. \n\nAs you
    yelp in pain you are left open.\n\nThe guard ahead of you quickly dashes forward,
    slicing your throat. Blodd spurts from your mouth, you feel the liquid filling
    your lungs, the world beginning to fade away as you fall to your knees.\n\nDarkness
    consumes your world..."
