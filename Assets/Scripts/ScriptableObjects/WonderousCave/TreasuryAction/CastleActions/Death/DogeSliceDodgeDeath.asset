  storyText: "You jump to your left evading the first bolt, then to the right.\n\nThe
    third bolt flies directly at you. \n\nQuickly raising your sword you slice the
    bolt in half, changing its direction, sending it flying over your shoulder. \n\nYou
    feel a sharp pain in your stomach, looking down you see a sword, as your eyes
    move upwards, blood spilling from your mouth and wound, you see the young soldier
    you disarmed panting and sweating. A warm feeling encompasses you as you fall
    to your knees, your world fading into darkness..."
