  storyText: "You jump backward, the bolt flies infront of you ricocheting off the
    wall towards you once again. \n\nThe end of the bolt appears in your vision, larger
    and larger.\n\nImmense pain surges from your eye, as you feel warm liquid running
    down your face.\n\nThe guard ahead of you rushes forward, removing your head with
    his sword whilst you remain stunned.\n\nYou see your own body fall to the floor,
    a feeling of warmth encompasses you as your world fades into darkness..."
