  storyText: "You drop to the ground feeling the bolt as it flies above your head
    with a sharp whistling noise.\n\nAs you pick yourself up you see a guards feet
    stood over you.\n\n\"Scum, I sentence you to death!\" the guard  bawls as he sharply
    lowers his sword, vertically, into your chest.\nAs you attempt to catch the blade
    you feel the blade shred through your hands, the force breaking your collar bone,
    then your ribs, then... \n\nA warm feeling encompasses you, your vision begins
    to fade into darkness, figures become blurred. The void consumes you..."
