  storyText: "You gleam over the guard, slowly pushing your sword further and further
    into his chest,\n\nblood spurts everywhere, the guard appears to be formulating
    words, but only muffled splutters can be heard. \n\nAs you slowly rip through
    the guard, you feel a sharp pain in your head, bone breaking, and a warm liqiud
    running down your face. Falling to the floor, you see a young solider to your
    left, a sword covered in blood. \n\nSlowly, figures begin to blur into silhouettes,
    you hear muffled voices as you are turned over by a foot.\n\nYour world fades
    into darkness..."
