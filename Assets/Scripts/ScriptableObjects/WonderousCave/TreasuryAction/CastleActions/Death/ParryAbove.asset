  storyText: 'You swing your sword upwards in a parry motion, missing the blade but
    slicing up the guards chest.


    As your head fills with relief you feel the momentum of the guards blade slicing
    through your neck, stopping midway.


    In tremendous pain you feel your head tilting to the side, unable to control it.
    Panic fills your mind as you begin to feel a warm liquid filling your lungs. You
    see the guard fall to the ground, entrails leaking from his body, as the world
    around you slowly fades into darkness...'
