  storyText: "You  spin your sword in front of you in an attempt to deflect the bolts.\n\nThe
    first bolt is sliced in half, but follows your blade around, the tip impaling
    your arm.\n\nThe second bolt is sent flying upwards.\n\nThe third bolt is successfully
    deflected.\n\nAs you prepare yourself to continue the fight the second arrow falls
    back down, finding its way into your skull. \nYou fall dizzy, falling to your
    knees as a weak-sick feeling encompasses you. Your world begins to fade to black
    as you cough for breath..."
