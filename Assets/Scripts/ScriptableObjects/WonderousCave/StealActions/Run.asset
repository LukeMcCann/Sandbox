  storyText: 'You attempt to run away, a bright light envelopes you. All of a sudden
    you see darkness, crashing into a solid obstacle.


    Picking yourself up, you realise you have been transported back into the corridor
    you found yourself in earlier.


    "Foolish mortal, learn your lesson or lose your life!" a voice bellows.


    Which corridor do you enter?


    1. Enter the first

    2. Enter the second

    3. Enter the third'
